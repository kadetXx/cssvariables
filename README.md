# Using Css Variables

This is a project made with inspiration from [freecodecamp's css variables tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/use-css-variables-to-change-several-elements-at-once). I decided to create y own illustration in order to practice using css variables so i opened a new [codepen](https://codepen.io/kadetXx/pen/NWGxmKw) and I ended up spending the whole afternoon making this small project.
